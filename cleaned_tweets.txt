b'Just get the vaccine, if you can. Stop worrying about the order.'
b'   You've failed to tell me whom you would take the vaccine away from in order to give it to teachers.'
b'   I don't think anyone would disagree with that, except maybe a hospital administrator. I also don't think that would free up enough vaccine to absolve upper-middle class white people of defining what they mean by "essential."'
b'   That's reasonable. Fact remains we're still a ways away from vaccinating all healthcare workers and older adults. It'll be March before we get to 1B. So when someone says vaccine teachers "now," that means they want someone else kicked out of line.'
b'  And we don't have enough vaccines because only a few companies make them because of the profit motive from holding the vaccine as intellectual property... sounds like the problem is capitalism!'
b' What you described is similar to what's happening, except I guess you'd boot some old people in favor of teachers. It would be amazing if we could do all of the above on the same track but there is only a certain amount of vaccine.'
b' 8 And I like this discussion. Blake, if you had to create the vaccine disbursement system, how would you do it? An honest logistical question.'

b'1994  Teachers would be fine with remaining remote. Kemp wants to open them back up. No vaccine has been approved for people under 16, which means teachers are in a crowded classroom of 20-30 students who can't be vaccinated at all.'

b'_ek So what do we do differently? These folks are endangering everyone around them. It's not like the MMR vaccine, where it took years until we started seeing measles outbreaks like the one we got in New York. We don't have years to get people on board - we have months, if not weeks.'
b' They get to spread covid, insisting on being maskless in the name of freedom. They get to increase the odds of a variant that we have no vaccine for. They get to stop others from being vaccinated. In other words, they get to kill us. Fuck their freedom! Abuse it, you loose it.'
b'_ _ewan   The problem is that some hospitals are seeing 50%-60% of staff refuse to take the vaccine because I guess they're stupid, so unfortunately this messaging is important. Pisses me the fuck off, if the tinfoil hats don't want their place in line, I'd gladly take it.'
b' So we absolutely need more vaccine, but we also need people to, candidly, sit down, shut the fuck up and take the vaccine when it's their turn. Some states found themselves stuck in phase 1a of their vaccine plans because moving to 1b required x% of vaccines given to folks in 1a.'
b' So there's two problems here.1) The vaccine is largely only available to health care workers and, in some places, elderly folks.2) Healthcare workers are stupid and have apparently fallen for the conspiracy theories and refusing to widely accept it. Selfish fucks make me angry.'

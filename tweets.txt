b'@megturney They get to spread covid, insisting on being maskless in the name of freedom. They get to increase the odds of a variant that we have no vaccine for. They get to stop others from being vaccinated. In other words, they get to kill us. Fuck their freedom! Abuse it, you loose it.'
b'@austinlawhead_ @obe_ewan @mustachetoilet @choloabel The problem is that some hospitals are seeing 50%-60% of staff refuse to take the vaccine because I guess they\xe2\x80\x99re stupid, so unfortunately this messaging is important. Pisses me the fuck off, if the tinfoil hats don\xe2\x80\x99t want their place in line, I\xe2\x80\x99d gladly take it.'
b'@mustachetoilet So we absolutely need more vaccine, but we also need people to, candidly, sit down, shut the fuck up and take the vaccine when it\xe2\x80\x99s their turn. Some states found themselves stuck in phase 1a of their vaccine plans because moving to 1b required x% of vaccines given to folks in 1a.'
b'@mustachetoilet So there\xe2\x80\x99s two problems here.1) The vaccine is largely only available to health care workers and, in some places, elderly folks.2) Healthcare workers are stupid and have apparently fallen for the conspiracy theories &amp; refusing to widely accept it. Selfish fucks make me angry.'

b'@FFrelih @barbie60144 @rapsallday2 @CPC_HQ @erinotoole Why does it matter if you still need to wear a mask and quarantine post vaccine'
b'@CandiceMalcolm @BillTufts @TrueNorthCentre Get the \xe2\x80\x9cvaccine\xe2\x80\x9d- still may test positive- still may transmit - still have to wear a mask- still have to social distance - still not exempt from travel restrictions Tell me again what the point is of getting a shot of experimental medical serum is.'
b"@WeAreCanProud Why does this matter? Why do we need a vaccine plan? A mask and quarantine is still required after the vaccine. It's absurd. Imagine if birth control was this way.What's the point ?"
b'@carmellabacklun @BadaSwich @mariem201 @sarahjanet Stop politicizing things that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a JT fan, but the more people blame him for every little thing, the more I\xe2\x80\x99m not a con. The lab was sold off, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a facility OR a vaccine to produce, it\xe2\x80\x99s as much JT\xe2\x80\x99s fault as it is the cons. There, done.'
b'@mariem201 @BadaSwich @carmellabacklun @sarahjanet Still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a Canadian vaccine to produce at the moment'
b'@carmellabacklun @sarahjanet As far as I am aware our labs haven\xe2\x80\x99t developed a vaccine.  I believe one will soon be starting human trials, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t just take a vaccine developed by someone else and make it here.'

b"@DtotheIzzoAcres @BrianPallister @roussin_brent I'm not going to pretend to be a doctor.  But ND/SD didn't do much and their curve is identical. The PCH are vaccinated and thats where 80% of deaths have been. More vaccine on the way for healthcare workers and elderly.  We are in the home stretch by the looks of it. Let's go."
b'@paulmrobertson1 @BigG_44 @BrianPallister @roussin_brent Going to be pretty interesting here in 2 months when all the snowbirds come home vaccinated by a foreign country before hardly any Canadians have it. Is the government going to make them quarantine etc...but the point of getting the vaccine is to return to normal??'
